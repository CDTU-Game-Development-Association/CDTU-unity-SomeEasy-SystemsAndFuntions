if you want to learn unity, maybe you can learn the GameInput in SomePlayerController.cs and then learn the Dialogue to konw how i try to have a clean and easy-to-use code.

Happy Coding.

## Now we only have a easy DialogueSystem and some skills,haha.

[DialogueSystem](LearnAndDoPls/Dialogue/README.EN_DialogueSystem.md)

I have chosen an easy-to-understand approach to writing the dialogue system. The Control serves as a controller, and by adding a Controller template, we can freely customize dialogues while keeping it easy to use. If you have a large amount of dialogue content, you can create prefabs, which will make your work much easier and more enjoyable.
