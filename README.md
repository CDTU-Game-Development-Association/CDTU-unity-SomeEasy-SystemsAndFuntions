For unity. Maybe you can check the contents of the "skills" folder to help improve your code..

Happy Coding.

## Now we only have a easy DialogueSystem and some skills,haha.

[DialogueSystem](LearnAndDoPls/Dialogue/README.EN_DialogueSystem.md)

I have chosen an easy-to-understand approach to writing the dialogue system. The Control serves as a controller, and by adding a Controller template, we can freely customize dialogues while keeping it easy to use. If you have a large amount of dialogue content, you can create prefabs, which will make your work much easier and more enjoyable.


##@whatevertogo I welcome anyone to point out the shortcomings of my code to help me improve.
