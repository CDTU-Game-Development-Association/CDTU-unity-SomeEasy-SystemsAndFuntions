使用此对话系统最好需要搭配unity3d中的预制件功能，这样可以更好的实现对话系统的功能，当然也可以自己实现，只需要在对话系统中调用对应的方法即可。
1.目前仅仅有分支对话(多分支对话需要自己魔改)，普通对话，拥有声音的对话。
2.可以根据需要魔改，这是一个通过unity预制件和scriptObject的对话系统实现
3.也许你需要一个预制体和不同的对话
 
总的来说如果有太多的对话SO，也许你需要自己改很多，但是这个对话系统的基本原理是很好理解的

=======================================================================

It is best to use this dialog system with the prefab function in Unity3D, so that you can better implement the function of the dialog system, of course, you can also implement it yourself, you only need to call the corresponding method in the dialog system.
1. At present, there are only branch dialogues (multi-branch dialogues need to be changed by yourself), ordinary dialogues, and dialogues with voices.
2. It can be magically modified as needed, which is implemented through the dialogue system of unity prefabs and scriptObjects
3.Maybe you can have a prefab like this:Of course with a different Dialogue which is created by yourself with the DialogueSO


All in all if there are too many DialogueSO maybe you should Change a lot by yourself,but it it surely good to understand the basic of the Dialogue System
